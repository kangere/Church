    <string name="children_genesis6">In Genesis 6 -9 we read the great biblical account of the flood; how God saved Noah, his family and all the animals in THE ARK.
“The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. TheLord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”  But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.”
This inspired us to be committed in bringing up a godly generation that would be found righteous in the midst of this wicked world.
God commanded Noah to Build an ARK so that he and his family would be safe from the floods that God was to send to destroy the earth. Noah obeyed and built an ARK as God instructed.</string>
    <string name="children_genesis7">Genesis 7:1 “The LORD then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.”
This is the reason “THE ARK” for the children’s ministry at Kileleshwa Covenant Community Church is committed to be used of God to save this generation for Him. We must save One More Generation for God (O.M.G) so that it shall be a trans-generational impact to all generations to come, hence each generation will save another generation for God.

    <string name="children_theme">THEME VERSE:</string>
    <string name="children_psalms">“We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, his power, and the wonders he has done.” (Psalm 78:4). Our mandate is to teach God’s word telling of his wonderful works so that the children will know the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</string>
    <string name="children_joshua">Joshua 2:10 “After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.” We must aggressively tell our children about God to avoid a time like mentioned above, where an entire generation did not know God nor his deeds.</string>
