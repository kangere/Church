        <item>In Genesis 6 -9 we read the great biblical account of the flood; how God saved Noah, his family and all the animals in THE ARK.
“The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. TheLord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”  But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.”
This inspired us to be committed in bringing up a godly generation that would be found righteous in the midst of this wicked world.
God commanded Noah to Build an ARK so that he and his family would be safe from the floods that God was to send to destroy the earth. Noah obeyed and built an ARK as God instructed.</item>

        <item>Bofu (a Chinese term that means spreading the good news).
We are a ministry that started in Feb 2014 within K3C. Our mission is to share the gospel, make disciples and plant Chinese churches among the Chinese Diaspora in Kenya. Our ultimate goal is to mobilize the Chinese believers to reach out to the many unreached people  in Africa and beyond.
After two years, Bofu has grown to more than 20 people. A number of coworkers from US and Hong Kong joined us. We now have women, children and basketball ministries. Recently, a missionary couple from China also joined us. We look forward for greater things to happen among the Chinese around Kileleshwa and beyond</item>
